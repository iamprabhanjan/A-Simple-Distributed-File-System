# Distributed File System Project


## Overview

Welcome to the Distributed File System (DFS) project! This project provides a simple yet powerful system for storing, managing, and retrieving files across multiple nodes. The system includes essential features such as file replication, load balancing, fault tolerance, and advanced consistency mechanisms.

## Features

- **File Replication**: Ensure data redundancy by replicating files across multiple nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute file storage evenly across nodes to optimize performance.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operations seamlessly even when one or more nodes fail.
- **Consistency Mechanisms**: Maintain data integrity with advanced consistency management.
